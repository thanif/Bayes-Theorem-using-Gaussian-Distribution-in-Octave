# Bayes-Theorem-using-Gaussian-Distribution-in-Octave



The Main script performs the following tasks:

Read the dataset.

From the training set determine the parameters of the Gaussian distribution (likelihood function).

Determine the predictions on the test data using Bayes' theorem assuming first a diagonal covariance matrix and then repeat with the complete covariance matrix.
